    ABCRejection(sim_func::Function, nparams::Int64, ϵ::Float64, prior::Prior; <keyword arguments>)

Create an ABCRejection type which will simulate data with sim_func. nparams is the number of parameters inputted into sim_func, ϵ is the target tolerance and prior sets the priors for the parameters. sim_func needs to take in 3 values, the parameters (in an array), constants (array) and target data in that order and needs to return 2 values, the first being the distance between the target data and simulated data and the second can be anything but is useful if for example you want to record some additional information about the simulations.
...
## Arguments
- `maxiterations = 10^5`: Maximum number of samples before the ABC algorithm terminates.
- `constants = []`: Any constants needed to simulate from sim_func
- `nparticles = 100`: Number of particles (ie samples) of ABC algorithm
